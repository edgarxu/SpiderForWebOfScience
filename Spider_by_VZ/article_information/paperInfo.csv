For the same purpose, a new path is explored based on rotating encoder signal (RES) by considering time-varying speed condition. In proposed method, generalized demodulation is firstly applied on second-order derivative of RES to eliminate the frequency variability caused by time-varying speed, and a combined comb filter is performed in this process to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of demodulated signal. The toothwise meshing information is then integrated as individual samples for the detection of local anomalies induced by gear defect. After reducing the dimensionality of these toothwise samples by reordered kernel principal component analysis, a normalized robust statistical distance is constructed to indicate the anomalies contained in RES. Simulation and experimental cases are provided to reveal the efficacy of the proposed method.","Gears,Vibrations,Planets,Demodulation,Shafts,Noise reduction,Frequency modulation,Dimensionality reduction,encoder signal analysis,time-varying speed",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,,"FAULT-DETECTION,VIBRATION,DIAGNOSIS",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS,,

In previous researches, a simple linear plane assumption for the gear crack trajectory was usually made and the crack closure effect was ignored. Based on the principle of linear elastic fracture mechanics, a threedimensional numerical model of planetary gear train crack propagation considering the initial crack location, ring gear backup ratio and constraint mode is built in this study. Considering the crack closure effect and the obtained crack trajectory, the meshing characteristics (including the time varying meshing stiffness (TVMS) and contact pressure) are investigated. The results indicate that when considering the crack closure effect, the reduction in the TVMS of the cracked gear decreases and the influence of the foundation crack closure effect on TVMS is greater than that of tooth crack closure effect. Appropriately constraining the outer rim of the thinner ring gear can help avoid catastrophic foundation crack, but the TVMS is more sensitive to the change in the backup ratio when only the pin support is restrained. The uneven distribution trend of cracked tooth contact pressure depends on the nonpenetrating crack type.","Crack propagation,Meshing characteristics,Crack closure effect,Constraint mode",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science",,3.233,"SPUR,GEAR,STIFFNESS,CALCULATION,FAILURE,ANALYSIS,FAULT-DIAGNOSIS,TOOTH,CRACK,SIMULATION,DYNAMICS,MODEL,TEETH,WIDTH",ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS,,

It leads to a challenge in the fault diagnosis, especially for the localized faults which stimulate resonance modulation phenomena. To reveal the resonance modulation mechanism of sun gear's localized fault, the vibration signal model is built based on the convolution of transient impact force and transfer function of the planetary gearbox. Three prominent transfer paths including modal parameters of the flexible ring gear or housing are involved to obtain resonance modulation sidebands. A projection function is used to model the time-varying direction of transient impact force. Resonance modulation sidebands of a single planet gear meshing is first deduced, and then the sidebands related to multiply planet gears meshing. The resonance modulation of localized fault on sun gear are concluded to be consist of three groups of sidebands.

However, the detection for the evolutionary status of surface wear in a planetary gear train is quite challengeable due to the complicated and weak characteristics buried in the vibration signals. To assess the wear status of gears in a planetary gear train, a sophisticated vibration signal analysis based methodology is proposed. First, an analytical dynamic model of single-stage planetary gear train is established, which incorporates the effects of distributed surface wear of mating gears. With the analytical dynamic model, a resultant vibration signal model is further established after considering the influences of transfer path, direction variation of gear action lines and background noise. This vibration signal model is used to represent the actual vibration signals collected by transducers installed on the housing of planetary gearbox. Based on the constructed resultant vibration signals, two novel fault indicators are defined to reveal the evolution law of fault symptom. The fault evolution symptom analysis is used to identify healthy status and wear status of mating gears in the planetary transmission system.

The traditional sideband energy ratio (SER) method limits its application to complex operational conditions due to the frequency spectrum based and manual bandwidth selection. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive order-band energy ratio (AOER) method, an enhanced version of the SER, to quantitatively and intelligently diagnose gear faults under different operational conditions. First, a signal model based on angular increment and order components is proposed to properly describe the vibrations for both stationary and non-stationary conditions. The proposed model provides the theoretical source and reliance for the order spectrum analysis and the diagnostic mechanism of the OER. Second, the OER is theoretically proved to be a reliable fault indicator by analyzing the proposed signal model. The offset of the uncertainty terms highlighting the fault symptoms demonstrates the potential success of using OER for the fault diagnosis. Finally, OERs generated from the vibration data and three typical machine learning algorithms are used to adaptively obtain the optimal bandwidth and thus the AOER. The AOER can be directly used for the remaining vibration data of the corresponding operational condition. Comparing with SER and the convolutional neural network, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and outperformance of AOER for both stationary and non stationary operational conditions. More importantly, since AOER can cope with diagnostic tasks for different operational conditions, it enables an improved ability to monitor a PG's health in the actual complex environment.","Adaptive order sideband energy ratio (AOER),Signal model,Variety operational conditions",Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, 24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Engineering,,6.662,"VOLD-KALMAN,FILTER,DEEP,NEURAL-NETWORKS,INTELLIGENT,DIAGNOSIS,MESHING,FREQUENCY,TRACKING,TRANSFORM",MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING,,

To tackle this problem, the technologies of variable multi-scale morphological filtering (VMSMF) and average multi-scale double symbolic dynamic entropy (AMDSDE) are proposed in this paper. VMSMF selects Chebyshev Window as the structural element and automatically selects the optimal-scale parameters according to the signal characteristics of the planetary gearbox, which improves the filtering accuracy and calculation efficiency. AMDSDE fully considers the correlation between various state modes. Once combined with relevant knowledge of Mathematical statistics, the algorithm can effectively reduce misjudgment. Firstly, the turn domain resampling (TDR) is used to transform the time domain signal of variable speed into the angle domain signal that is not affected by speed change. Secondly, the proposed VMSMF is used to de-noise the vibration signal, and the fault signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio is obtained. Finally, AMDSDE is used to extract the entropy value of the fault signal and judge the fault type.

Accordingly, the continuous irregular fluctuations of gearbox under variable conditions maybe increase the intraclass difference and reduce the interclass difference for the monitored samples. To this end, a new intelligent fault diagnosis method of gearbox based on adaptive intraclass and interclass convolutional neural network (AIICNN) under variable working conditions is proposed. The core of the proposed algorithm is to apply the designed intraclass and interclass constraints to improve the distribution differences of samples. Meanwhile, the adaptive activation function is added into the 1-D convolutional neural network (1dCNN) to enlarge the heterogeneous distance and narrow the homogeneous distance of samples. Specifically, the training sample subset with intraclass and interclass spacing fluctuations under variable conditions is first converted into frequency domain through the fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the designed AIICNN algorithm is employed for model training.

The WTDS mostly contains one planetary gear stage and two parallel gear stages. Sun gear is a significant component in the planetary gear stage and is prone to fail under fatigue loading due to the bending and shear effect. Crack is most likely to occur in the gear tooth root and it decreases the tooth thickness and load-carrying capacity of the gear. The presence of crack decreases the tooth contact number and tooth contact position during the time of meshing. This leads to a variation and quantified reduction in the time varying mesh stiffness (TVMS) of a meshing gear pair. Hence, a dynamic model is developed by including different crack depth levels in the sun gear. The governing equations for the model are derived using Lagrange's formulation and dynamic responses are obtained numerically by step-by-step direct integration method. The dynamic responses like contact forces and angular velocities are estimated at 0%, 10%, and 30% of crack depth in the sun gear tooth and analysed to study the dynamic behaviour of the drive-train for un-cracked and cracked gears beforehand.","Wind turbine drive-train,Mathematical modelling,Time varying mesh stiffness,Tooth crack,Dynamic response",Article; Early Access,"SPRINGER INDIA, 7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",Engineering,,,"FAULT-DIAGNOSIS,PLANETARY,GEAR,DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS,DRIVE,TRAIN,SPUR,GEAR,MESH,STIFFNESS,ROOT,CRACK,VIBRATION,SIMULATION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,

On the basis of VS, multi-teeth VS is proposed to extract and synthesize the meshing signal of a planet gear using a single transducer. Considering the movement regularity of a planetary gearbox, the time-varying transfer function (TVTF) is represented by a generalized expression. The TVTF is constructed using a segment of healthy signal and an evaluation indicator is established to optimize the parameters of the TVTF. The constructed TVTF is applied to overcome the amplitude modulation effect and highlight fault characteristics.

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods based on vibration analysis have been continuously developed in rotating mechanical fault diagnosis (MFD). However, current diagnostic models based on DL facing three major challenges: (1) Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL algorithms lose spatial information of features, which may inevitably cause recognition errors; (2) Sufficient faulty training samples must be required to guarantee the learning capability of DL models, which may not be satisfied in actual engineering; (3) The poor generality of existing DL-based models make it difficult for different rotating machines or even different components of a mechanical device for diagnostic tasks. Toward the above problems, a revised DL model, namely dual convolution-capsule network (DC-CN), is introduced to diagnose rotating machinery faults under minor sample conditions. The DC-CN well merits the advantages of CNN and the capsule network (CN), which fully retains spatial information while digging in-depth fault features. Therefore, DC-CN achieves an ideal balance between diagnostic effectiveness and data amount. Experiments including different rotating machinery and different fault components are conducted to validate the diagnostic performance of the proposed model, and the tSNE dimensionality reduction algorithm is introduced to visualize the extracted features. The proposed DC-CN demonstrated the best diagnostic capability than other DL models in different rotating machinery: 1. For rolling bearing, DC-CN achieved 99.78%, 98.22%, 100%, and 100% under 4 different loading conditions; 2.

Model-based gearbox fault diagnosis techniques extract hand-crafted features from sensor data based on underlying physics and statistical analysis, which are not effective in extracting spatial and temporal features automatically. While deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) enable automatic feature extraction from multiple sensor sources, they are not capable of extracting spatial and temporal features simultaneously without losing critical feature information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel deep neural network based on bidirectional-convolutional long shortterm memory (BiConvLSTM) networks to determine the type, location, and direction of planetary gearbox faults by extracting spatial and temporal features from both vibration and rotational speed measurements automatically and simultaneously. In particular, a CNN determines spatial correlations between two measurements within one time step automatically by combining signals collected from three accelerometers and one tachometer. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks identify temporal dependencies between two adjacent time steps. By replacing input-tostate and state-to-state operations in the LSTM cell with convolutional operations, the BiConvLSTM can learn spatial correlations and temporal dependencies without losing critical features.

Current IBD methods mainly utilize the intrinsic prior knowledge of impulsive sources to design various regularization terms (e.g., kurtosis, sparsity) to alleviate its ill-posedness. However, the great potentiality of statistical distribution structures embedded in observation data hasn't been exploited to establish more effective model and algorithm for IBD problem. Leveraging recent plug-and-play (PnP) strategy, a convolutional sparse optimization framework (dubbed COPS) is proposed to address it. Firstly, based on the fact that the absolute envelope of Gaussian noises follows a Rayleigh distribution and sparse impulsive components can be viewed as its outliers, a noise-aware statistical threshold is introduced to design a data-driven sparse penalty. Secondly, from a Bayesian perspective, a mapping relation between residual distribution and model hyper-parameter is unveiled, and then an adaptive parameter penalty is established to dynamically select model hyper-parameters. Lastly, two penalties are plugged into ADMM solver by PnP strategy to guarantee algorithmic convergence. Comprehensive numerical simulations confirm the COPS's advantages in terms of robustness, convergence, scalability and effectiveness. Diagnostic results of planetary gearbox faults further corroborate the COPS retains better deconvolutional accuracy than the state-of-the-art IBD techniques. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

20,Component matching chirplet transform via frequency-dependent chirp rate for wind turbine planetary gearbox fault diagnostics under variable speed condition,161,,,"Miaofen Li,Tianyang Wang,Fulei Chu,Zhipeng Feng","Li MF,Wang TY,Chu FL,Feng ZP",,10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107997,,"A component matching chirplet transform (CMCT) via frequency-dependent chirp rate with high time-frequency (TF) resolution is proposed for wind turbine planetary gearbox (WTPG) fault diagnostics under variable speed condition. The challenge of identifying fault-related frequencies with small intervals, due to the time-varying rotational speed and complex structure of WTPG, can be well addressed. Unlike conventional chirplet transform, CMCT can generate a family of frequency-dependent chirplets, which can match all frequency components with a sufficiently high TF resolution. Furthermore, this proposed method does not require any prior knowledge. The effectiveness of CMCT is validated by a numerical simulation and an experimental data collected from a wind turbine drivetrain test rig.","Chirplet transform,Wind turbine,Variable speed condition",Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, 24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Engineering,,6.662,"TIME-DOMAIN,AVERAGES,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,SUN,GEAR,VIBRATION",MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING,,
